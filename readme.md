# Free IPTV
## An extensive, curated and legal IPTV list

### What is this?
This is a curated list of **free and legal** streams from various IPTV services. The current list of IPTV services that are included is:
* Pluto.tv
* STIRR
* PLEX
* SamsungTVPlus

### Did you gather all these links?
No. Full credit for the grabbing of all the streams and EPG data goes to @matthuisman and his excellent work. All I have done is curate the list to my own personal liking, weeding out duplicates (such as *SamsungTVPlus* using channels from *Pluto.tv*) and renaming some channels to be more 'list friendly'. The most extensive work I have done is creating a monochrome logo pack for the channels that are all the same resolution.

### How can I use these channels?
You can use these channels by adding the following URL's to pretty much any IPTV app, including the likes of Kodi, Emby, etc. I won't list a 'how-to' here since there are so many different apps available, but you can find walkthrough's for almost all apps by just Google searching for your app of choice with the search term 'setup' added.
